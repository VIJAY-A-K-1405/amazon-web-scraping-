## Amazon web scraping

# I'm pleased to share my latest mini project—a robust Amazon Data Scraper built with Python. This project not only automates the extraction of product details such as titles, prices, ratings, review counts, and availability from Amazon but also showcases my capabilities in web scraping and data processing.

## Key Highlights:

Technology Stack:
• Python
• BeautifulSoup & Requests for web scraping
• Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation and cleaning

# Project Workflow:

Data Extraction: Automated retrieval of product details from Amazon pages.

Data Parsing: Parsing HTML content to accurately extract necessary fields.

Data Cleaning: Utilizing Pandas to handle missing values and structure the data.

Output: Generating a clean CSV file ready for analysis.

# Learning Outcomes:

• Enhanced expertise in parsing complex HTML structures.
• Improved skills in automating data collection and handling real-world datasets.
• Gained deeper insights into data cleaning and transformation techniques.

A special thanks to the tutorial that inspired this project @darshilparmar. I'm excited about the potential of these skills in tackling more data-driven challenges and look forward to connecting with professionals who share a passion for data science and automation.
